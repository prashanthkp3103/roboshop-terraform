# Optional - The name for workflow runs generated from the workflow, which will appear in the list of workflow runs on your repository's "Actions" tab. This example uses an expression with the `github` context to display the username of the actor that triggered the workflow run. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#run-name)."
#run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is learning GitHub Actions

# Specifies the trigger for this workflow. This example uses the `push` event, so a workflow run is triggered every time someone pushes a change to the repository or merges a pull request.  This is triggered by a push to every branch; for examples of syntax that runs only on pushes to specific branches, paths, or tags, see "[AUTOTITLE](/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore)."
